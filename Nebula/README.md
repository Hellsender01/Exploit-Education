# Nebula

## About

Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at

- SUID files
- Permissions
- Race conditions
- Shell meta-variables
- $PATH weaknesses
- Scripting language weaknesses
- Binary compilation failures

At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.

## Download

Downloads are available from the [downloads page](https://github.com/ExploitEducation/Nebula/releases/download/v5.0.0/exploit-exercises-nebula-5.iso).

## Getting started

Have a look at the levels available on the side bar, and log into the virtual machine as the username “levelXX” with a password of “levelXX” (without quotes), where XX is the level number. Some levels can be done purely remotely.

## Getting root

In case you need root access to change stuff (such as key mappings, etc), you can do the following:

Log in as the “nebula” user account with the password “nebula” (both without quotes), followed by “sudo -s” with the password “nebula”. You’ll then have root privileges in order to change whatever needs to be changed.
