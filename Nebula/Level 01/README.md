## Source Code

```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```

## Solution

After reading above code it can easily be observed that echo was being called without [absolute path](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/absolute-path-vs-relative-path-linuxunix/). So we can exploit this by creating our own echo program in /tmp and add /tmp to [PATH](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux) environment variable and when flag00 binary will call echo our /tmp/echo file containing reverse shell will get executed

We got shell !!!
