use CGI qw{param};

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub ping {
  $host = $_[0];

  print("<html><head><title>Ping results</title></head><body><pre>");

  @output = `ping -c 3 $host 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) { print "$line"; }

  print("</pre></body></html>");
  
}

# check if Host set. if not, display normal page, etc

ping(param("Host"));
```
